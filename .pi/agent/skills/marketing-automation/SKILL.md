## Лучшие практики

1. **Segment everything** — персонализированные nurture paths по сегментам
2. **Score behavior AND fit** — комбинируйте behavioral и demographic scoring
3. **Respect preferences** — предлагайте preference center
4. **Test continuously** — A/B тестируйте subject lines, CTAs, timing
5. **Clean your lists** — регулярная гигиена базы критична для deliverability
6. **Align with sales** — согласуйте MQL критерии и handoff процесс с продажами
