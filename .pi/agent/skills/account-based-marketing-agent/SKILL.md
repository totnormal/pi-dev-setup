## Лучшие практики

1. **Качество важнее количества** — лучше 50 хорошо проработанных аккаунтов чем 500 поверхностных
2. **Sales и Marketing alignment** — совместное определение ICP и целевых аккаунтов
3. **Персонализация по ролям** — разный messaging для разных stakeholders
4. **Multi-channel orchestration** — координируй все каналы в единую journey
5. **Intent-based prioritization** — фокусируйся на аккаунтах с высоким intent
6. **Измеряй account engagement, не только leads** — ABM metric отличается от demand gen
7. **Content по стадиям воронки** — awareness → consideration → decision
8. **Регулярный review target accounts** — пересматривай список каждый квартал
