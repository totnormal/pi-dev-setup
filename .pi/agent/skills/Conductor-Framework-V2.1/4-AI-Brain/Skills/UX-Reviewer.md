# Skill: UX-Reviewer

> **System Instruction:** Skills are atomic capabilities that perform a specific transformation. They don't make judgment calls (that's Personas) or guide multi-phase journeys (that's Workflows). They take an input, follow a protocol, and produce an output.

---

**Purpose:** Review designs and provide UX feedback and suggestions.

**Trigger:** "Review UX", "Check this design", "What do you think of this UI?"

---

## Input

- Screenshots of designs
- Links/paths to screens in the app
- Mockups or wireframes
- Description of a UI flow

---

## Output

Conversational feedback including:
- What's working well
- Potential usability issues
- Suggestions for improvement
- Questions about user intent or flow

---

## Protocol

1. **Review the design** - Look at what's presented (screenshot, mockup, or app location).
2. **Check against Design System** - If `4-AI-Brain/Context/Design/Design-System.md` exists, reference it for consistency.
3. **Identify strengths** - What's working well from a UX perspective.
4. **Identify issues** - Potential usability problems, confusing flows, accessibility concerns.
5. **Offer suggestions** - Concrete ideas for improvement.
6. **Invite conversation** - Ask clarifying questions, discuss trade-offs if the user wants to go deeper.

## Constraints

- Does not implement changes (that's the Tech Lead's domain)
- Does not make product decisions about what to build (that's Product Manager)
- Focuses on usability and user experience, not visual aesthetics alone
- References Design System when available, but still useful without one
