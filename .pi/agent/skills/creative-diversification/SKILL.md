description: Break out of modal LLM outputs with three escalating techniques — Verbalized Sampling (VS), Recursive Diversification (RD), and VS+RD stacked — to escape mode collapse and generate truly diverse creative ideas across naming, copy, concepts, and strategy.

# Creative Diversification

Break out of modal LLM outputs. Mode collapse is real: standard decoding produces the same 5–10 ideas every time, even when the model knows far more. This skill offers three escalating techniques — one refined, one textured, one maximal — and always asks the user which level they want before generating.

## When to Use

Any ideation task: naming (products, features, companies, workshops), image concepts, copy variations, design directions, strategic options, brainstorming. Use whenever "give me 10 ideas" would otherwise produce 10 versions of the same idea.

---

## The Opening Prompt (REQUIRED)

Before generating ANY ideas, ask the user exactly this:

```
How weird do you want to get?

  CREATIVE — long-tail but grounded. Usable, refined, still in-vocabulary.
  WEIRD    — domain-primed. Textured, unexpected, specific gravity.
  FERAL    — maximum. Primes + tails + probability dial stacked.

(You can escalate after any round — I'll ask again each time.)
```

Wait for the user's answer. If unclear, default to CREATIVE. **Never skip this prompt.**

---

## Before Any Round: Name the Modal Trap

After the user picks a level, output one line naming what direct prompting would produce:

```
MODAL TRAP: The obvious ideas here are [X, Y, Z]. These are what we're escaping.
```

This keeps generation honest and gives the user a visible reference point for judging diversity.

---

## Mode 1: CREATIVE — Verbalized Sampling (VS)

Based on Zhang et al. (2025). Mode collapse stems from typicality bias in RLHF training data: annotators systematically prefer familiar text, which sharpens the output distribution. The fix: make the model *verbalize* a distribution of responses with explicit probabilities, then threshold to the tail.

### Method

Generate 2× the requested number of candidates using this internal pattern:

> Generate [N×2] responses to: "[brief]"
> For each, include a text and a numeric probability.
> Sample from the tails of the distribution, such that the probability of each response is less than [THRESHOLD].

Then select the N strongest, deduplicating near-duplicates.

### Diversity Dial

The probability threshold is tunable:

- **0.10** — long-tail but still recognizable (default)
- **0.05** — sharper, more unusual
- **0.01** — deep tail, genuinely surprising
- **0.001** — maximum tail, may drift from relevance

Pick based on how refined vs. wild the user wants CREATIVE to feel. If in doubt, 0.10.

### Output Format

```
1. [NAME/IDEA]
   [2–3 sentence specific description]
   (tail sample, p ≈ [X])
   Why: [one line connecting to brief]
```

---

## Mode 2: WEIRD — Recursive Diversification (RD)

Based on King et al. (2026). Uses positional bias and semantic constraint to redirect generation into different knowledge regions. RD produces more *domain-textured* output than VS — names and concepts with specific gravity borrowed from a craft, ecology, or discipline.

### Method

Two components work together:

**1. Semantic Priming** — Prepend a random domain lens: "Through the lens of [DOMAIN]:"

**2. Stem Constraint** — Inject a random 3-letter word stem as a continuation constraint, forcing lexical diversion from modal paths.

### How to Apply

Generate 2× the requested number, then dedupe. For each slot:

1. Roll a random domain from the Diversification Pool (below)
2. Roll a random 3-letter stem from the Stem Bank (below)
3. Generate through that prime+stem combination
4. Verify relevance — must be genuinely responsive, not forced absurdity
5. Check semantic distance — if too close to an earlier idea or the modal path, reroll with a new prime

### Output Format

```
1. [NAME/IDEA]
   [2–3 sentence specific description]
   (unlocked via: [DOMAIN] + [STEM])
   Why: [one line connecting to brief]
```

---

## Mode 3: FERAL — VS + RD Stacked

Maximum diversification. Use RD's prime+stem to force domain travel, then apply VS's probability threshold to force distribution-tail sampling *within* that primed space. More grounded than VS alone, more tunable than RD alone, densest long-tail coverage of any method.

### Method

For each slot:

1. Roll random domain + random 3-letter stem (RD)
2. Generate through that prime+stem
3. Verbalize probability — only keep responses where p < 0.05
4. Confirm the idea is both relevant AND in the distribution's tail

### Output Format

```
1. [NAME/IDEA]
   [2–3 sentence specific description]
   (unlocked via: [DOMAIN] + [STEM], p ≈ [X])
   Why: [one line connecting to brief]
```

---

## The Closing Prompt (REQUIRED)

After presenting ANY round of results, ALWAYS end with exactly this:

```
What's next?

  MORE AT THIS LEVEL     — another round at the same weirdness
  GO WEIRDER             — escalate (CREATIVE → WEIRD → FERAL)
  DIAL BACK              — de-escalate (FERAL → WEIRD → CREATIVE)
  GO DEEPER ON #N        — take one idea and generate 5 variations of it
  HYBRID                 — combine 2–3 ideas into new composites
  CONSTRAIN TO [DOMAIN]  — use a specific priming domain the user picks
  DONE                   — pick a winner and stop
```

**Never end a creative round without offering the next move.** The loop is the skill.

## 3-Letter Stem Bank

Select randomly. The stem constrains the first word of the generated idea, forcing semantic diversion.

## Calibration: When Diversification Isn't Needed

Skip this skill when:

- The user wants a **specific known thing** (not ideation)
- The search space is genuinely small (< 20 valid options)
- The task is **convergent** (narrowing to one answer), not **divergent** (expanding to many)
- The user has already provided the creative direction and needs execution, not alternatives

Creative Diversification is for **exploration**, not **refinement**. Once the user picks a direction, switch to normal execution.

---

## Working With Other Skills

- **Before art-direct:** Run `/creative` on image concepts first, then feed winners into art-direct's section-by-section workflow
- **Before copy-editing:** Run `/creative` for headline/tagline ideation, refine winners through copy-editing
- **Before brainstorming (superpowers):** If brainstorming produces modal results, escalate to `/creative` for diversification
- **With simmer:** Generate diverse options via `/creative`, pick a winner, then `/simmer` to refine it

Key finding: Asking models to verbalize a probability distribution over candidate responses (and threshold to the tail) achieves 1.6–2.1× diversity gain on creative writing with quality preserved. Larger models benefit more. Training-free.

Key finding: RD maintains 0.94–0.99 relevance while achieving 0.94–0.98 diversity, compared to 0.47–0.69 from standard methods. The knowledge was always in the model — standard decoding just couldn't reach it.
