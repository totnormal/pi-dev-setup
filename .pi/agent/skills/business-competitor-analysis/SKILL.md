1. **Extract business information** from provided details or website
2. **Define target customer profile** (required)
3. **Identify top 5 competitors** via web search
4. **Research each competitor** across key dimensions
5. **Identify market gaps and opportunities**
6. **Synthesize findings** into structured report with citations

## Step 1: Extract Business Information

**If user provides a website URL:**
1. Fetch the URL using `web_fetch`
2. Extract: company name, value proposition, target market, products/services, pricing (if visible), key differentiators

**If user provides business details directly:**
1. Parse the provided information
2. Identify any gaps that require web research to fill

<REQUIRED>
For both cases, you may perform web research to fill in any missing information or gather the required context outlined below.
</REQUIRED>

**Required business context to gather:**
- Company name and description
- Industry/vertical
- Target customer segment (B2B/B2C, size, geography)
- Core products/services
- Pricing model (if discoverable)
- Key value propositions

## Step 2: Define Target Customer Profile

**This step is required.** Understanding the target customer enables accurate assessment of direct vs. indirect competitors and market positioning.

Research and document the target customer across these dimensions:

### Firmographics
- Company size (employees, revenue range)
- Industry/vertical focus
- Geographic markets served
- Technology maturity level

### Psychographics & Pain Points
- Top 3-5 pain points the product addresses
- Primary goals and desired outcomes
- Current alternatives or workarounds
- Decision-making criteria and priorities
- Budgetary constraints

### Behavioral Patterns
- How customers currently solve this problem
- Where they search for solutions
- Typical buying process and timeline
- Key stakeholders in purchase decision

### Market Sizing (if discoverable)
- Total addressable market (TAM) estimates
- Serviceable addressable market (SAM)
- Market growth trends and projections

**Research approaches:**
- Search "[industry] market size" and "[product category] target market"
- Review the subject company's "customers" or "case studies" pages
- Check industry reports, analyst research, market studies
- Use the subject company's messaging to infer customer profile

For detailed examples and frameworks, refer to `references/competitive-analysis-framework.md`.

## Step 3: Identify Top 5 Competitors

Run targeted searches to find direct competitors:

```
Search queries to use:
- "[company name] competitors"
- "[product category] companies"
- "[industry] [target market] solutions"
- "alternatives to [company name]"
- "[core service] providers [geography if relevant]"
```

Select the top 5 most relevant direct competitors based on:
- Similar target market and customer segment
- Overlapping product/service offerings
- Comparable business model
- Market presence and visibility in search results

## Step 4: Research Each Competitor

For each competitor, gather data across four dimensions:

### 4a. Market Positioning & Messaging
- Fetch competitor homepage and about page
- Extract: tagline, value proposition, target audience messaging
- Note: tone, positioning (premium/budget/mid-market), key claims

### 4b. Pricing & Business Model
- Search "[competitor] pricing" and fetch pricing pages
- Document: pricing tiers, model (subscription/one-time/freemium), entry price point
- If pricing not public, note this and search for any available information

### 4c. Product/Feature Comparison
- Review product pages and feature lists
- Identify: core features, unique capabilities, integrations, limitations
- Note any recent product launches or announcements

### 4d. Funding & Company Size
- Search "[competitor] funding" and "[competitor] company size"
- Check for: Crunchbase mentions, LinkedIn company size, press releases
- Document: funding rounds, total raised, employee count estimates, founding year

## Step 5: Identify Market Gaps & Opportunities

After researching competitors, systematically identify gaps in the competitive landscape:

### What to Look For

**Underserved customer segments:**
- Which customer types or use cases do competitors ignore or serve poorly?
- Are there geographic, size, or industry segments with limited options?

**Feature/capability gaps:**
- What functionality is missing across all competitors?
- What do customers request that no one provides well?
- What emerging needs are competitors slow to address?

**Positioning gaps:**
- What market positions are unclaimed? (e.g., "affordable enterprise-grade", "developer-first", "compliance-focused")
- Are there price points without strong offerings?
- Are there business models (e.g., usage-based, freemium) competitors avoid?

**Approach/philosophy gaps:**
- Do all competitors share assumptions the subject company challenges?
- Are there cultural or regional needs competitors overlook?

Document 3-5 specific gaps with supporting evidence from competitor research.

## Step 6: Synthesize Report

Generate markdown report following the exact structure below.

## Output Template

<REQUIRED>
Save the output to a markdown file with the template structure below.

- [ ] Target Customer Profile completed with firmographics, pain points, and behavioral patterns
- [ ] All 5 competitors researched across all 4 dimensions
- [ ] Every factual claim has inline citation
- [ ] Competitive matrix is complete with no empty cells (use "N/A" or "Not disclosed" if needed)
- [ ] Market Gaps section identifies at least 3 specific gaps with evidence
- [ ] SWOT items are specific and evidence-based, not generic

## Error Handling

**If competitor website is inaccessible:** Note in report, use available search results and news coverage instead.

**If pricing not public:** State "Pricing not publicly disclosed" and note any indirect indicators (e.g., "enterprise sales model suggested by 'Contact Us' pricing page").

**If funding data unavailable:** Search for alternative signals: LinkedIn employee count, office locations, news mentions of growth.

**If fewer than 5 clear competitors exist:** Include available competitors and note the market context (e.g., "Emerging market with limited direct competitors").
