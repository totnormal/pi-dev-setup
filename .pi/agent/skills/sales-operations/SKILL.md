## Лучшие практики

1. **Process before tools** — определи процесс, потом автоматизируй
2. **Data quality first** — мусор на входе = мусор на выходе
3. **Inspect what you expect** — регулярные ревью pipeline
4. **Forecast accuracy focus** — точность > оптимизм
5. **Enable, don't police** — помогай продавать, не усложняй
6. **Continuous improvement** — итерации на основе данных
