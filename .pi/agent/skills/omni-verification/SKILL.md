# Omni Verification

## Goals

- run the planned checks from `.omni/TESTS.md`
- summarize pass/fail status clearly
- produce a compact retry brief when checks fail

## Rules

- keep verification deterministic when possible
- separate implementation failure from environment failure
- make the next action obvious
