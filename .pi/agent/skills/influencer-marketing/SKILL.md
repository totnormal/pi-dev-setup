        campaign['agency_fees'],
        campaign['paid_amplification']
    ])

    # Direct revenue (tracked conversions)
    direct_revenue = campaign['attributed_sales']

    # Estimated earned media value
    emv = (
        campaign['impressions'] * 0.005 +  # CPM equivalent
        campaign['engagements'] * 0.50     # CPE equivalent
    )

    # Total value
    total_value = direct_revenue + emv

    return {
        'total_cost': total_cost,
        'direct_revenue': direct_revenue,
        'emv': emv,
        'total_value': total_value,

## Лучшие практики

1. **Authenticity first** — выбирайте по fit, не только по reach
2. **Long-term relationships** — амбассадоры эффективнее разовых постов
3. **Creative freedom** — дайте инфлюенсерам их голос
4. **Clear disclosure** — FTC compliance обязателен
5. **Performance tracking** — уникальные ссылки и коды
6. **Diversification** — mix разных тиров и платформ
