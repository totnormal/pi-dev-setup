      Subject: {Trigger event}

      Hi {First Name},

      Saw {company} just {trigger event}. When {similar companies}
      hit this milestone, they typically face {challenge}.

      We helped {reference customer} navigate this by {outcome}.

      Worth a quick call to see if we can help?

      Subject: {Pain point} at {Company}

      Hi {First Name},

      {Role} leaders at {industry} companies tell me their biggest
      challenge is {specific pain point}.

      We've helped {customer} reduce {metric} by {result} in {time}.

      Would it make sense to explore if we can do the same for {Company}?

    referral_request: |
      Subject: Quick question

      Hi {First Name},

      I'm trying to connect with whoever handles {function} at {Company}.

                 so I don't waste your time?"

    already_have_solution:
      response: "That's actually why I called. Companies using

                 experience too?"

## Лучшие практики

1. **Research before outreach** — 10-15 минут на каждый account
2. **Multi-channel cadences** — комбинируй email, звонки, LinkedIn
3. **Personalization at scale** — уникальные первые строки
4. **Listen more than talk** — 70/30 ratio на discovery
5. **Track everything** — данные = улучшение
6. **Follow up relentlessly** — 80% сделок требуют 5+ touchpoints
